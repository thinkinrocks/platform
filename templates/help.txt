Hello! I am the <b>Thinkin' Rocks*</b> management bot!

I am designed to help you interact with our infra.

We index our stuff using IDs, for example `<code>USBFLASH-001-AZ7</code>`. The first part is the human-readable name of the item. The second is a serial incrementing number. The tail is just 3 random alphanumeric characters. The bot only understands those IDs.

- <code>/me</code> checks your identity as you are in our system
- <code>/search [query]</code> searches our database
- <code>/cart [id1] [id2] ... [id2]</code> adds items to your cart
- <code>/cart</code> shows the list of items you currently have selected
- <code>/check [id]</code> displays detailde item information
- <code>/help</code> or <code>/start</code> shows this list
- <code>/tts [message]</code> sends a text-to-speech message to our HQ

<i>Thank you for taking interest in our stuff! If something seems broken reach out to @ktnlvr or <a href="https://github.com/thinkinrocks/platform">look at the code yourself</a>.</i>
